# Web Visualization Dashboard

I used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showcase the analytical skills I have learned.

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages  contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It also has a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Features

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Containing all of the visualizations on the same page so it is easy to visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
   * The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table is a bootstrap table component. 
  * The data comes from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML.

At the top of every page, the website has a working navigation menu.
